# Hosting a Web Page On Your Pod

### Introduction

Solid is 100% backwards compatible with the existing web.  Hosting a webpage on your pod couldnt be easier.  It can either be a normal HTML page.  Or interactive using JavaScript.

### The Hack

Browse to your solid pod.  Now, go to your public folder and click the green + sign on your [databrowser](https://github.com/solid/userguide) and click the source icon.

![Create a webpage with the databrowser](.gitbook/assets/hacks-webpage%20%281%29.png)

This will create a file webpage.html in your folder.  Expand webpage.html and hover over the top which will give you the ability to edit the source.

In the textbox type in something \(or paste\) something suitably kitch.  Example

```text
<h2>Hello</h2>

Solid World!
```

And click the green tick.  Congratulations, you have now published your first web page to solid!

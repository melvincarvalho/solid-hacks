# Hosting a Web Page On Your Pod

### Introduction

This hack enables you to host traditional web pages on your Solid pod.  Solid is 100% backwards compatible with the existing web.  Hosting a webpage on your pod couldn't be easier.  It can either be a normal HTML page.  Or interactive using JavaScript.

We're going to create public web page hosted on your Solid pod, which can be accessed from: 

[https://{yourname.solidpod}/public/mysite/webpage.html](https://{yourname.solidpod}/public/mysite/webpage.html)

### The Hack

Browse to your solid pod. Since you want to offer your web page to everyone on the Internet go to your `public` folder. Within your `public` folder click the green + sign on your [databrowser](https://github.com/solid/userguide) and click the `folder` icon and give this new folder the name _mysite_. Now click the new green + sign within the _mysite_ folder and create a new `source` by clicking the icon and give this the name `webpage.html`.

This will create a file `webpage.html` in your public _mysite_ folder. Expand webpage.html and hover over the top which will give you the ability to edit the source.

In the textbox type in something \(or paste\) something suitably kitch. Example

```text
<h2>Hello</h2>

Solid World!
```

And click the green tick. Congratulations, you have now published your first web page to solid!

**Tip 1** Drag and drop a file to the green plus and it will be uploaded to that directory.

**Tip 2** If you want to start a site within the _mysite_ folder, you can name the HTML file `index.html` and this way the contents of the folder will not be shown as a Solid Pod folder, but your HTML file will be used instead.
